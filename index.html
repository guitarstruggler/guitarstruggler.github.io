Chances are, if you are reading this blog, you are struggling with guitar. The reason for making this blog was to share my experiences with you on&nbsp;which exercises worked and which did not. They are completely subjective. They worked for me, might not work for you and vice-versa.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">
My story of the&nbsp; guitar blues</div>
I went to music school in my early years around ten, now I am 46. (in 2017)<br />
I was basically disqualified from solfege ( a must for a year in my country before they even let you touch guitar) due to my lack of hearing, short fingers, no singing voice and no idea why I had to draw those plums on or in between the lines (staff). <br />
I waited until now, thinking I can only ever be a listener, until a friend showed me his tuning machine and said I should go for it and try playing. The very first obstacle ie. inability to tune the guitar due to my "bad" hearing was cleared, so I set out on my journey to learn to play the guitar. Cheap acoustic, I bought for a hundred bucks. Not takin' any risk eh?!<br />
<br />
Self-taught I wanted to be, what I shame it would have been going to a teacher and being told the bad news (ie. lack of talent) again. All internet based teachers will tell you on Youtube you can do it, and not hear you pluck away badly.<br />
<br />
So let's strum it folks!<br />
<br />
I started off with the "simple open chords". A,E, D and such. Practised like a good boy, everyday, for months. The result? Could not get a chord change decently in a minute, let alone play anything. So, more and more searching for the ultimate online guitar intructions. Learn guitar in a month, in a few hours, anybody can do it. No good. Planned to set my guitar on fire, bang it against the wall, smash it to pieces.<br />
So I switched to playing melodies. Short easy ones. Suprisingly they went okay. If I could play melodies why couldn't I play them easy chords?<br />
<br />
Spent a whole year struggling. Imagine after 12 months of reasonable practice time I could not get a good sounding chord change down. Cut me hands off in desperation. I wanted to give up.<br />
Last chance, more searching for the ultimate exercise, all of them said:practise, practise, practise. NOT TRUE my friends. At least not with my abilities.<br />
<br />
Then I came across a few instructors over the net and in person, who said it ain't easy, it takes time and dexterity that you gotta develop. What a revelation, no fasttracking, cutting corners etc. and from then on I started to get it. Two months after practising the right stuff I was brave enough to find a teacher. It's been&nbsp; months since my first official guitar lesson. On my first lesson, the teacher said my basic chords were fine and my technique acceptable and we carried on with more difficult ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will detail the exercises and 2 books that REALLY helped me get ahead.<br />

Attitude:</div>
</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Do not be a hobbyist</li>
<li>Imagine you will have to make a living out of your guitar (even if it's not the case) and practise accordingly.&nbsp; Place yourself mentally in a crowded bar and try to get your guitar be heard!&nbsp;</li>
<li>Put your soul into playing</li>
<li>Do not practise when you are too tired, it's useless and frustrating.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br />
Practice:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Go to a teacher if you can</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Leave your Guitar out on a stand.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Posture: get in the classical, took 2 days to accustom but made a huge difference.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Chord practice: extend the fingers form the chords in the air, , then again back to the chord. Practise. Strum with a pick to hear the strings. Slowly! Should be able to form the chord before fingers touch the strings.</li>
<li>Chord changes: chord-release-form the new chord in the air-press- strum. Very slowly. Gotta be perfect.&nbsp;</li>
<li>What is perfect? All fingers touch the strings at once, no more adjustments of the fingers once they touched the strings. (difficult but aim for it) Anchor fingers did not do good to me, rely on them once you can form the chords, not before. Think like a sniper, aim for the right spot with all fingers and only then press down, otherwise you will rely on microadjustments after pressing down.&nbsp;</li>
<li>What if my 1. and 2. fingers touched first and only then my 3. and 4.? I started with 3. and 4. (F or dm). Start with the fingers that resist, or have the furthest to go and only then place the ones that go easily. Keep practising this way and then practise all together. Feels awkward but helps.</li>
<li>Practice time: I have no good advice on this one. Try between 300-600 repetitions a day. Eg.: one chord change @ a rate of&nbsp; 60 BPM for 5 mintutes will give you 150 one-directional repetitions from&nbsp; one chord to the other. Hence 10 mins/day for a single chord change.</li>
<li>Increase the difficulty if you're ok at 60BPM increase it incrementally until you can barely do it.</li>
<li>Make up your own exercises by isolating your weaknesses, for eg practise one directional chord change only.</li>
<li>Be relaxed and tension free .</li>
<li>Once you improve, you will spend more time on developing chord progressions. Stay in rhythm, pay attention to your strumming hand as well. Get a steady beat and try to go for the chords without altering the rhythm. This made a huge difference in my practice. My strumming hand became the conductor and my fretting hand followed it.</li>
<li>Tap your foot in rhythm.</li>
<li>Do not choke the guitar neck, hold it as lightly as possible</li>
<li>Confuse your fingers, for eg: put&nbsp; finger 1 on a string at a comfortable fret pluck the string, then place 2-3-4 together then&nbsp; pluck again (exercise from Guitar principles) when your happy with it and can do it at a&nbsp; a reasonable tempo perfectly then try placing 1-2- together and then 3-4 and go up the strings (physically down), then back to the original sequence. This will keep you focussed and gets rid of automatism. You need to controll those fingers.</li>

Science:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Learning has a vast literature. The most well known about guitar was written by a cognitive psychologist: Gary Marcus: From guitar zero to guitar hero.<br />
Now, what he described in his book seemed to me like a full immersion course. Unfortunately that's not my case.</div>
<div>
It is widely agreed that in order to be an outstanding musician one needs ten thousand hours over ten years of practice. That is true for many professions, and I speak from experience.&nbsp; A world- famous celloist, at the age of 90 was&nbsp; once asked why he kept practising every day.&nbsp; - "Because I keep progressing!"- was his answer.<br />
<br />
The brain:<br />
<br />
while muscle memory is often cited in the guitar tutorials, there is no such thing. It is confined to the brain and muscles execute orders from the brain, in return they also send&nbsp; signals back to the brain about tension, position etc. I will explain later on why this is good news for us.<br />
Scientific research as-far as I know- has yet to determine the optimal number of repetition and/or duration of practice in order to be effective. Currently the number of repetitions known to be effective in stroke patients to relearn motor skills are between 300-600 repetitions a day (eg. in 2 sessions) 5 days a week and it seems to be as efficacious as 4-5 hours a day.<br />
Long term memory will take about 6 weeks to develop. It is also known that during sleep long term memory is formed. So sleep well guys.<br />
Young children are able to learn without paying attention, they just pick-up new skills whereas&nbsp; after the age of 12, one needs to pay attention. This is to do with brain development. So concentrate and if your mind wanders stop, have a break or increase the difficulty (eg. tempo) so that you pay attention again.<br />
So we are actually training our mind, not our fingers. Now comes the good news. You can train your brain by&nbsp; visualization alone. This hypotheses was tested on piano, and it turned out that by imagining playing the piano during practice had ALMOST the same effect as physically practising. Brain development happens by imagination and concentration alone! Magic. No, it's a scientific fact. Just think how F1 drivers drive round the circuit mentally before a race. So if you can't play your guitar, imagine you are playing. Get a detailed picture of the fretboard as if it were in your lap and play in your mind.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
There are other factors though, that are known to help achieve one's learning goals:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Record yourself and watch it with a critical eye on a regular bases.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Play with others.</div>
<div>
Try not to miss too many days without practising.</div>
<div>
As people get older distractions become more and more difficult to handle. In one study it was found that distractions were handled more efficiently&nbsp; by the young then by older subjects. That might be one of the reasons why people think it impossible to learn a new skill later in life. So try to focus and minimize distractions. Prepare your mind in advance for practice.</div>
<div>
Get enough sleep, and stay away from agents that hinder fine motor skills.</div>
<div>
In my personal experience I found that the ability to handle frustrations during practice will have a great impact on efficiency. I am convinced that children handle them much much better and hence they (frustrations)&nbsp; do not inhibit learning. I get angry with myself for being clumsy and it doesn't do good.</div>
<div>
Introduce a slight change in your practice routine, that is also known to help.</div>
<div>
Avoid injuries, posture related sore backs etc. at all costs. Your fingertips may hurt a bit, but that's all.</div>
<div>
Tapping a rhythm slows dementia and helps Parkinsonism. Whata great benefit!</div>
<div>
Never ever give up!<br />
Chewing gum improves mental performance and learning. (the scientific explanation behind it is very complex and probably not yet fully understood, but works)<br />
<br />
An obstacle to speed<br />
<br />
When I started off, my practice was basically chord-strum, change chord- strum, the reverse. Slowly, perfectly. While this is the way to learn a chord-chord change, it is actually the opposite of what guitar playing is.<br />
<br />
Your strumming hand dictates the rhythm and your fretting hand gets there in time hence the music. This is a turning point, because that's the way to add speed and rhythm. As soon as you get to the point of being able to change a chord reasonably well, you have to shift focus to your strumming hand and also get your fretting hand on the chord in time. This way you not only build speed but small fretting hand problems will show up that remain hidden in a slow perfect practice. Observe yourself while doing this, find out the mistakes, decrease the speed and correct them. Then return to the faster pace. So by varying slow-fast you can correct your mistakes and improve. If needed practice a single change only eg. D-F only and not F-D. It easier to speed up and isolate mistakes.<br />
If strumming is a problem mute the strings and strum only.<br />
<br />
Try strummin at 60/min , and fret the chords perfectly at the pace that feels comfortable. You will find it is difficult to keep the strum precise and focus on the fretting hand at the same time, but eventually that is what needs to be perfected.<br />
<br />
There are some views that one cannot increase speed, due to the ratio of fast/slow twitch muscles,&nbsp; which is an inherited thing, this is not case in the hand, so fear no more. Genetics will not hinder you.<br />
